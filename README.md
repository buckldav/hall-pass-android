"# hall-pass-android" 

This is an app I made for secondary educators in Utah. Several teachers I work with wanted an app that would track when students use a hall pass with a timestamp sent to Google Sheets. This app allows users to import class rolls (with Google Sheets) and send that timestamp information when students enter/exit class.

This app uses Google's API and Google Play services and their terms apply to usage for the app. Their terms of service can be found at https://developers.google.com/terms.
